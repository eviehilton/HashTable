public class ChainedHashTable {
	/*Implement a Java class named ChainedHashTable, based on a hash table with chaining using the multiplication method from the slides/textbook. Your should use an array of LinkedList<Integer> objects as your primary instance variable / data field.
The constructor should have a parameter for n, the total number of inputs expected. In the constructor, create the array of size m as the first power of 2 larger than n, full of constructed but empty linked lists at each index. You may choose A directly, or use the integer fraction method.
There should also be public methods for insert, delete, and search as in the slides/textbook.
I also want a public printTable method, which runs a loop and prints each linked list in the hash table; consider using the LinkedList class toString method. Alternatively, you can define the toString method to return a string rather than printing it.
You will need a private helper method named hash. Given an int key, it computes and returns an int index of the table.
5 points extra credit: 
Use a Universal collection of hash functions instead of the multiplication method, for the ChainedHashTable class above. 
The the prime number p > m and the randomly constants a and b should be chosen in the constructor. 
Make sure your prime number selection is runtime-efficient! 
If you need help with this math algorithm to find the next prime number bigger than natural number m,
 I recommend going to the Math Lab in the 3rd floor of RRO.*/
